      <title>Problems with Reels and Social Media Propaganda</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me share something deeply troubling I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently. This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;reels&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we&amp;rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; &lt;em&gt;some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only&lt;/em&gt;. Even more alarming are parents who put their &lt;strong&gt;children&lt;/strong&gt; at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year back I started learning coding. Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that &amp;ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?&amp;rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term &amp;ldquo;Growth Mindset.&amp;rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Behind the Scenes in Politics</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,&amp;rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content. I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inverted Quarantine</title>
      <link>http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000. This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Capitalism VS Communism: Who killed more ?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-vs-communism/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;has-capitalism-killed-more-people-than-communism-throughout-history&#34;&gt;Has capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets dive into details. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many arguments agains communism that says -  Mao &amp;ldquo;killed 40 million&amp;rdquo; and is thus eviler than Hitler who &amp;ldquo;killed 12 million&amp;rdquo;. The modern day &amp;ldquo;death toll contests&amp;rdquo; spawned from boomer-tier memes comparing &amp;ldquo;evil dictators death counts&amp;rdquo; are pointless and devoid of context. Yet ignoring that these roundups tend to undercount victims of Nazism, the deaths in China were due to mismanagement and incompetence. The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-your-argument-to-i-have-nothing-to-hide&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your argument to &amp;ldquo;I have nothing to hide&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am by far the most privacy oriented of my friends, and whenever they see me use Firefox or do something other than the norm for privacy They just say, &amp;ldquo;I have nothing to hide&amp;rdquo;. What do you say when someone does this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focusing-on-hiding-is-the-wrong-attitude&#34;&gt;Focusing on &amp;ldquo;hiding&amp;rdquo; is the wrong attitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, &amp;ldquo;Privacy&amp;rdquo; is just the right to control your own data and your public image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Capitalism is a Driving Force of Climate Change</title>
      <link>http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-climate/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unseen Consequences of Capitalism on the Environment and Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, economic growth, and social inequality, it is essential to examine the underlying drivers of these issues. The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election. This staggering number is a testament to the power of social media in spreading misinformation. Fast-forward to the present, and it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president&amp;rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun. — Seth Godin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell myself that I blog for my own sake. I write to express, to put thoughts out there for my own reflection. I publish things because it helps me tame my thinking. And yet, that tiny toast button somehow becomes a bigger deal than it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be lying if I say I don’t check the stats. I’m a numbers guy, drawn to tracking things: views and upvotes etc &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i follow an artist on Tumblr who’s been doing a daily drawing since a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they’re mostly self portraits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his work is expressive, somewhat childlike, and genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes he shows pictures of all his notebooks lined up neatly on a wall shelf. years of daily moments recorded with pencils and other colorful media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;IMG_6366&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/veronique/img_6366.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a couple of things inspire me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;along with his daily drawings that he posts, he writes a few lines about his day. they’re short snippets of thoughts or daily happenings that leave the reader wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why GDP is not a good measure of Human WellBeing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 12:27:14 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-gdp-is-not-a-good-measuring-tool&#34;&gt;Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a widely used measure of a country&amp;rsquo;s economic performance. However, it has several limitations that make it a flawed metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-gdp-measures&#34;&gt;What GDP Measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country&amp;rsquo;s borders. It includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending
Investment
Government spending
Exports
Imports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limitations-of-gdp&#34;&gt;Limitations of GDP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignores Quality:&lt;/strong&gt; GDP focuses on the quantity of goods and services, not their quality. This means that a country with high-quality healthcare services may still have a low GDP if it has a large number of low-skilled jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GDP Is the Wrong Tool for Measuring What Matters</title>
      <link>http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity. The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
