      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unseen Consequences of Capitalism on the Environment and Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, economic growth, and social inequality, it is essential to examine the underlying drivers of these issues. The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election. This staggering number is a testament to the power of social media in spreading misinformation. Fast-forward to the present, and it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president&amp;rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nobody Reads Your Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun. — Seth Godin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell myself that I blog for my own sake. I write to express, to put thoughts out there for my own reflection. I publish essays because it helps me tame my thinking. And yet, that tiny toast button somehow becomes a bigger deal than it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be lying if I say I don’t check the stats. I’m a numbers guy, drawn to tracking things: views and upvotes &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i follow an artist on Tumblr who’s been doing a daily drawing since a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they’re mostly self portraits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;his work is expressive, somewhat childlike, and genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes he shows pictures of all his notebooks lined up neatly on a wall shelf. years of daily moments recorded with pencils and other colorful media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;IMG_6366&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/veronique/img_6366.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a couple of things inspire me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;along with his daily drawings that he posts, he writes a few lines about his day. they’re short snippets of thoughts or daily happenings that leave the reader wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why GDP is not a good measure of Human WellBeing</title>
      <link>https://example.org/posts/gdp2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-gdp-is-not-a-good-measuring-tool&#34;&gt;Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a widely used measure of a country&amp;rsquo;s economic performance. However, it has several limitations that make it a flawed metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-gdp-measures&#34;&gt;What GDP Measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country&amp;rsquo;s borders. It includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending
Investment
Government spending
Exports
Imports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limitations-of-gdp&#34;&gt;Limitations of GDP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignores Quality:&lt;/strong&gt; GDP focuses on the quantity of goods and services, not their quality. This means that a country with high-quality healthcare services may still have a low GDP if it has a large number of low-skilled jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GDP Is the Wrong Tool for Measuring What Matters</title>
      <link>https://example.org/posts/gdp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity. The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
