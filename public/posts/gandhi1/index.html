  <div class="post-content"><p>The ideology of Gandhi’s assassin has become mainstream in the country, while Gandhi himself has been demonized for promoting Hindu-Muslim unity.</p>
<p>Why do many Indians hate Gandhi? It’s not that he is universally hated; many love and idolize him. However, After all one of them killed him, pumping bullets into a frail old man of peace merely to settle a political argument. Some acknowledge his flaws yet still recognize his greatness.</p>
<p>A systematic campaign has been and is being run to malign him. To pit him against other great contemporaries and introduce rivalries that perhaps did not exist. To magnify his flaws. To downplay his achievements. Rewrite history to suit the politics of a particular ideology. A lot of youngsters, most of whom are ignorant of any history beyond WhatsApp forwards most of which are fake, have been brainwashed to hate him and spread that hate. They do so mindlessly because they know nothing better and it gives them a sense of belonging. Some of them are, of course, paid to do it.</p>
<p>Despite the reasons for this hatred, I don’t believe Gandhi would be concerned about it. He might have responded with something like, “The odd thing about assassins is they think they&rsquo;ve killed you.”</p>
<p>Recently, we hear more people praising Godse, the man who assassinated the 78-year-old Gandhi. It’s important to explore where this admiration originates and who is promoting such views. After assassinating Gandhi, both the RSS and Savarkar distanced themselves from him, with Savarkar even lying in court to protect himself. This reflects their two faced attitude.</p>
<p>In his mind, the only way to redeem himself was through a drastic act: to show the world and his peers at the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha that he was capable of something significant, even if it meant committing murder. Godse represent troubled youth and there was nothing revolutionary about his sociopathic behaviour or his decision to murder Gandhi.</p>
<p>A lot of people who are attracted to Godse are probably troubled and sociopathic themselves. These people have murderous tendencies. But since they realize, it will have consequences, they stick to petty adulation of figures like Godse on Social media, to feel distinguished and different.</p>
<p>I would like to add that Gandhi was not particularly the saint that Gandhiwadis make him out to be. His views on caste and race were problematic. So were his views on science, on modern medicine. But Gandhi was and is one the finest Politically Shrewd minds to have been born in India. Gandhi&rsquo;s fervent adoption of non-violence and secularism ensured that the India did not become dysfunctional as a nation like some other African countries post the independence from the colonial powers. Gandhi is to be credited for India&rsquo;s multiculturalism — for the fact that we had in India people like Abdul Kalam and Captain Hamid who gave their everything to this nation. Gandhi&rsquo;s insistence on mutual love, on tolerance ensured that India had people from all walks of life, from different religions, caste, sects who worked together to contribute to greatness of this nation.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the fringe, anti-social elements nobody can deny his contribution to the country. Godse on the other is only famous for brutally killing a 78 year old man and then getting hanged after being abandoned by his peers and the organizations he used to work for.</p>
<p>Godse at the end of the day was just “a poor misguided, angry, sociopathic young man&quot; who was used as a tool by the shrewd Savarkar who we all know worked behind the scenes, sought pardon from the British Empire, then joined hands with the British, secured a pension and even got a house in Ratnagiri for his loyalty to the British.</p>
<p>Godse is symbolic of how poor disenfranchised youth are taken advantage of and become victims of hypocritical politic of Right Wing Parties in India.</p>
