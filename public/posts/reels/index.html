      Problems with Reels and Instagram Propaganda

  <div class="post-content"><p>Let me share something deeply troubling I&rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently. This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the &ldquo;<strong>reels</strong>&rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we&rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; <em>some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only</em>. Even more alarming are parents who put their <strong>children</strong> at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as <em>modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines</em>. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don&rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don&rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as <strong>thought leaders</strong>. Somehow, they&rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.</p>
<p>The situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; <strong>they teach people what to think</strong>. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—<strong>they&rsquo;re programming how people think</strong>. It&rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t just random posts we&rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. <strong>They&rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives.</strong> The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. </p>
<p>The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn&rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their <strong>primary source of knowledge and opinion formation</strong>. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. </p>
<p>When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators&rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.</p>
<p>This says a lot about lack of <strong>critical thinking</strong> in our society. While it&rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.</p>
<p>This raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don&rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.</p>
