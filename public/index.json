[{"content":"The ideology of Gandhi’s assassin has become mainstream in the country, while Gandhi himself has been demonized for promoting Hindu-Muslim unity.\nWhy do many Indians hate Gandhi? It’s not that he is universally hated; many love and idolize him. However, After all one of them killed him, pumping bullets into a frail old man of peace merely to settle a political argument. Some acknowledge his flaws yet still recognize his greatness.\nA systematic campaign has been and is being run to malign him. To pit him against other great contemporaries and introduce rivalries that perhaps did not exist. To magnify his flaws. To downplay his achievements. Rewrite history to suit the politics of a particular ideology. A lot of youngsters, most of whom are ignorant of any history beyond WhatsApp forwards most of which are fake, have been brainwashed to hate him and spread that hate. They do so mindlessly because they know nothing better and it gives them a sense of belonging. Some of them are, of course, paid to do it.\nDespite the reasons for this hatred, I don’t believe Gandhi would be concerned about it. He might have responded with something like, “The odd thing about assassins is they think they\u0026rsquo;ve killed you.”\nRecently, we hear more people praising Godse, the man who assassinated the 78-year-old Gandhi. It’s important to explore where this admiration originates and who is promoting such views. After assassinating Gandhi, both the RSS and Savarkar distanced themselves from him, with Savarkar even lying in court to protect himself. This reflects their two faced attitude.\nIn his mind, the only way to redeem himself was through a drastic act: to show the world and his peers at the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha that he was capable of something significant, even if it meant committing murder. Godse represent troubled youth and there was nothing revolutionary about his sociopathic behaviour or his decision to murder Gandhi.\nA lot of people who are attracted to Godse are probably troubled and sociopathic themselves. These people have murderous tendencies. But since they realize, it will have consequences, they stick to petty adulation of figures like Godse on Social media, to feel distinguished and different.\nI would like to add that Gandhi was not particularly the saint that Gandhiwadis make him out to be. His views on caste and race were problematic. So were his views on science, on modern medicine. But Gandhi was and is one the finest Politically Shrewd minds to have been born in India. Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s fervent adoption of non-violence and secularism ensured that the India did not become dysfunctional as a nation like some other African countries post the independence from the colonial powers. Gandhi is to be credited for India\u0026rsquo;s multiculturalism — for the fact that we had in India people like Abdul Kalam and Captain Hamid who gave their everything to this nation. Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s insistence on mutual love, on tolerance ensured that India had people from all walks of life, from different religions, caste, sects who worked together to contribute to greatness of this nation.\nLeaving aside the fringe, anti-social elements nobody can deny his contribution to the country. Godse on the other is only famous for brutally killing a 78 year old man and then getting hanged after being abandoned by his peers and the organizations he used to work for.\nGodse at the end of the day was just “a poor misguided, angry, sociopathic young man\u0026quot; who was used as a tool by the shrewd Savarkar who we all know worked behind the scenes, sought pardon from the British Empire, then joined hands with the British, secured a pension and even got a house in Ratnagiri for his loyalty to the British.\nGodse is symbolic of how poor disenfranchised youth are taken advantage of and become victims of hypocritical politic of Right Wing Parties in India.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/gandhi1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe ideology of Gandhi’s assassin has become mainstream in the country, while Gandhi himself has been demonized for promoting Hindu-Muslim unity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do many Indians hate Gandhi?

People look up to them like they are superheroes and can rescue us from our misery. Whether it is existential dread or political chaos, we seem convinced that the solution lies in a celebrity. People project narratives onto them. The reality is far more complex.\nThe Diljit Dosanjh situation perfectly illustrates this phenomenon. When right-wing activists tried to shut down his Indore concert, he responded by quoting Rahat Indori\u0026rsquo;s powerful lines, \u0026ldquo;Kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai!\u0026rdquo; (India belongs to no one\u0026rsquo;s father). After this incident, people cast Diljit as the last hope against right-wing ideologies, a symbol of resistance.\nThen came the plot twist and the narrative didn\u0026rsquo;t last long when Diljit posted an image with PM Modi ji. People were shocked, How could their anti-establishment hero do this? Their \u0026ldquo;anti-establishment hero\u0026rdquo; was suddenly revealed to be\u0026hellip; just another celebrity navigating the complex landscape of public life and professional relationships.\nThis is the power of mass indoctrination, where people assign meanings to celebrities that they might not embody in reality. What’s happening here? People assign revolutionary labels to celebs without asking if they’re even interested in that role. Do they want to be seen as revolutionaries?\nThere is something seductive about fame, even back in ancient times = Plato said in The Republic (It\u0026rsquo;s a book not Arnab\u0026rsquo;s channel): \u0026ldquo;The highest form of recognition is not for the individual, but for the ideas they stand for.\u0026rdquo;\nBut then standing for the ideas is almost impossible when you have achieved the idea of celebrityhood. In a neoliberal framework, celebrities are commodities, their brand value curated by public relations teams, social media managers, and marketing strategists. We see the celebrity as an individual, ignoring the massive machinery behind them. Celebrities often craft an illusion of relatability—that they think and feel like us. This branding requires effort. Kapil Sharma’s comedy show which is a celeb image-maintenance platform masquerading as a comedy show. Questions like, “Do you buy vegetables yourself?” keep the facade alive of them struggling with everyday issues. This is how many stars often say, “Mujhe toh English words nahi aate,” despite speaking the language fluently, to strike a chord with the insecurities of common people. This is a calculated and smartly curated denial of class privilege, a desperate act of posing as lower class to safeguard upper-class dominance.\nThe internet, in this age of endless information overload, constantly throws new facts at us, reminding us that the people we once admired have, at some point, might have been \u0026lsquo;problematic.\u0026rsquo; And hence, now they are no longer consumable.\nThis consistent disillusionment has created a sense of cultural orphanage, where we are now desperately seeking new daddies daily. Yet failing it, every time. The desperation is both laughable and tragic, that evokes Nietzsche’s observation: “The lonely one offers his hand too quickly to anyone who will reach for it.” Or Perhaps rapper MC Stan who once said :\n“Ek din pyaar phir doosre din tum hate karte\nTeesre din beemar phir chauthe din tum wait karte”\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/celebs/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOur society\u0026rsquo;s celebrity worship has reached absurd levels, whether it is a hip-hop artist, actor, or athlete.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.
