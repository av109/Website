[{"content":"Let me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently. This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly ==funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas==. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. ==It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment==.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Yet ignoring that these roundups tend to undercount victims of Nazism, the deaths in China were due to mismanagement and incompetence. The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive. That\u0026rsquo;s not counting imperialist wars, people who die from unsafe working conditions, slave trading, etc.\nfor active learning You can watch this video\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-vs-communism/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"has-capitalism-killed-more-people-than-communism-throughout-history\"\u003eHas capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow lets dive into details.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours.

This staggering number is a testament to the power of social media in spreading misinformation. Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself.

If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism.

The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

A good health diet not only fuels our bodies with essential nutrients but also nurtures our minds and spirits. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the foundations of a balanced diet, uncover the benefits of wholesome foods, and provide practical tips for incorporating nutritious meals into your daily routine.\nUnderstanding the Importance of Nutrition: Nutrition plays a pivotal role in promoting optimal health and preventing chronic diseases. A well-rounded diet provides our bodies with the essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants needed to support vital functions, boost immunity, and maintain energy levels. By prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, we can enhance our physical health, mental clarity, and emotional well-being.\nKey Components of a Good Health Diet: A good health diet is characterized by balance, variety, and moderation. Here are the key components of a nutritious diet:\nWhole Grains: Incorporate whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat into your meals. Whole grains are rich in fiber, which aids digestion, promotes satiety, and helps regulate blood sugar levels.\nFruits and Vegetables: Load up on a colorful array of fruits and vegetables, which are packed with vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re getting a wide range of nutrients and antioxidants.\nLean Proteins: Include lean sources of protein such as poultry, fish, tofu, beans, lentils, and legumes in your diet. Protein is essential for muscle repair, immune function, and hormone production.\nHealthy Fats: Incorporate healthy fats into your diet from sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish like salmon and mackerel. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are particularly beneficial for heart health and brain function.\nDairy or Dairy Alternatives: Choose low-fat dairy products or dairy alternatives fortified with calcium and vitamin D, such as almond milk, soy milk, or coconut yogurt. Dairy products provide essential nutrients like calcium and protein, which are crucial for bone health and muscle function.\nPractical Tips for Healthy Eating: Here are some practical tips to help you maintain a good health diet:\nPlan Ahead: Plan your meals and snacks in advance to ensure you have nutritious options on hand. Stock your kitchen with wholesome ingredients and prepare healthy meals and snacks ahead of time.\nPractice Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes, and listen to your body\u0026rsquo;s hunger and fullness cues.\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support optimal bodily functions. Limit sugary drinks and opt for water, herbal teas, or infused water instead.\nLimit Processed Foods: Minimize your intake of processed and refined foods, which are often high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Instead, focus on whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible.\nEnjoy Treats in Moderation: It\u0026rsquo;s okay to indulge in your favorite treats occasionally, but do so in moderation. Allow yourself to enjoy a small serving of dessert or a savory snack without guilt.\nConclusion: A good health diet is a cornerstone of well-being, providing the nourishment our bodies need to thrive. By prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, practicing portion control, and embracing healthy eating habits, you can cultivate a balanced diet that supports your physical, mental, and emotional health.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly ==funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas==. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. ==It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment==.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ?

And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail?

While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

A good health diet not only fuels our bodies with essential nutrients but also nurtures our minds and spirits. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the foundations of a balanced diet, uncover the benefits of wholesome foods, and provide practical tips for incorporating nutritious meals into your daily routine.\nUnderstanding the Importance of Nutrition: Nutrition plays a pivotal role in promoting optimal health and preventing chronic diseases. A well-rounded diet provides our bodies with the essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants needed to support vital functions, boost immunity, and maintain energy levels. By prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, we can enhance our physical health, mental clarity, and emotional well-being.\nKey Components of a Good Health Diet: A good health diet is characterized by balance, variety, and moderation. Here are the key components of a nutritious diet:\nWhole Grains: Incorporate whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat into your meals. Whole grains are rich in fiber, which aids digestion, promotes satiety, and helps regulate blood sugar levels.\nFruits and Vegetables: Load up on a colorful array of fruits and vegetables, which are packed with vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re getting a wide range of nutrients and antioxidants.\nLean Proteins: Include lean sources of protein such as poultry, fish, tofu, beans, lentils, and legumes in your diet. Protein is essential for muscle repair, immune function, and hormone production.\nHealthy Fats: Incorporate healthy fats into your diet from sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish like salmon and mackerel. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are particularly beneficial for heart health and brain function.\nDairy or Dairy Alternatives: Choose low-fat dairy products or dairy alternatives fortified with calcium and vitamin D, such as almond milk, soy milk, or coconut yogurt. Dairy products provide essential nutrients like calcium and protein, which are crucial for bone health and muscle function.\nPractical Tips for Healthy Eating: Here are some practical tips to help you maintain a good health diet:\nPlan Ahead: Plan your meals and snacks in advance to ensure you have nutritious options on hand. Stock your kitchen with wholesome ingredients and prepare healthy meals and snacks ahead of time.\nPractice Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes, and listen to your body\u0026rsquo;s hunger and fullness cues.\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support optimal bodily functions. Limit sugary drinks and opt for water, herbal teas, or infused water instead.\nLimit Processed Foods: Minimize your intake of processed and refined foods, which are often high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Instead, focus on whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible.\nEnjoy Treats in Moderation: It\u0026rsquo;s okay to indulge in your favorite treats occasionally, but do so in moderation. Allow yourself to enjoy a small serving of dessert or a savory snack without guilt.\nConclusion: A good health diet is a cornerstone of well-being, providing the nourishment our bodies need to thrive. By prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, practicing portion control, and embracing healthy eating habits, you can cultivate a balanced diet that supports your physical, mental, and emotional health.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly ==funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas==. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. ==It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment==.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail?

While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

A good health diet not only fuels our bodies with essential nutrients but also nurtures our minds and spirits. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the foundations of a balanced diet, uncover the benefits of wholesome foods, and provide practical tips for incorporating nutritious meals into your daily routine.\nUnderstanding the Importance of Nutrition: Nutrition plays a pivotal role in promoting optimal health and preventing chronic diseases. A well-rounded diet provides our bodies with the essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants needed to support vital functions, boost immunity, and maintain energy levels. By prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, we can enhance our physical health, mental clarity, and emotional well-being.\nKey Components of a Good Health Diet: A good health diet is characterized by balance, variety, and moderation. Here are the key components of a nutritious diet:\nWhole Grains: Incorporate whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat into your meals. Whole grains are rich in fiber, which aids digestion, promotes satiety, and helps regulate blood sugar levels.\nFruits and Vegetables: Load up on a colorful array of fruits and vegetables, which are packed with vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re getting a wide range of nutrients and antioxidants.\nLean Proteins: Include lean sources of protein such as poultry, fish, tofu, beans, lentils, and legumes in your diet. Protein is essential for muscle repair, immune function, and hormone production.\nHealthy Fats: Incorporate healthy fats into your diet from sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish like salmon and mackerel. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are particularly beneficial for heart health and brain function.\nDairy or Dairy Alternatives: Choose low-fat dairy products or dairy alternatives fortified with calcium and vitamin D, such as almond milk, soy milk, or coconut yogurt. Dairy products provide essential nutrients like calcium and protein, which are crucial for bone health and muscle function.\nPractical Tips for Healthy Eating: Here are some practical tips to help you maintain a good health diet:\nPlan Ahead: Plan your meals and snacks in advance to ensure you have nutritious options on hand. Stock your kitchen with wholesome ingredients and prepare healthy meals and snacks ahead of time.\nPractice Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes, and listen to your body\u0026rsquo;s hunger and fullness cues.\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support optimal bodily functions. Limit sugary drinks and opt for water, herbal teas, or infused water instead.\nLimit Processed Foods: Minimize your intake of processed and refined foods, which are often high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Instead, focus on whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible.\nEnjoy Treats in Moderation: It\u0026rsquo;s okay to indulge in your favorite treats occasionally, but do so in moderation. Allow yourself to enjoy a small serving of dessert or a savory snack without guilt.\nConclusion: A good health diet is a cornerstone of well-being, providing the nourishment our bodies need to thrive. By prioritizing nutrient-dense foods, practicing portion control, and embracing healthy eating habits, you can cultivate a balanced diet that supports your physical, mental, and emotional health.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly ==funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas==. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. ==It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment==.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad.

He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

TLDR; without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\nNow lets dive into details. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many arguments agains communism that says - Mao \u0026ldquo;killed 40 million\u0026rdquo; and is thus eviler than Hitler who \u0026ldquo;killed 12 million\u0026rdquo;. The modern day \u0026ldquo;death toll contests\u0026rdquo; spawned from boomer-tier memes comparing \u0026ldquo;evil dictators death counts\u0026rdquo; are pointless and devoid of context. Yet ignoring that these roundups tend to undercount victims of Nazism, the deaths in China were due to mismanagement and incompetence. The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive. That\u0026rsquo;s not counting imperialist wars, people who die from unsafe working conditions, slave trading, etc.\nfor active learning You can watch this video\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-vs-communism/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"has-capitalism-killed-more-people-than-communism-throughout-history\"\u003eHas capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow lets dive into details.

I am by far the most privacy oriented of my friends, and whenever they see me use Firefox or do something other than the norm for privacy They just say, \u0026ldquo;I have nothing to hide\u0026rdquo;. What do you say when someone does this?\nFocusing on \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; is the wrong attitude First of all, \u0026ldquo;Privacy\u0026rdquo; is just the right to control your own data and your public image.\n“Arguing that you don\u0026rsquo;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don\u0026rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” ― Edward Snowden\nPrivacy isn\u0026rsquo;t about hiding something. It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ? Why ? Can I see your credit-card bills for the last year ? Why not ? I don\u0026rsquo;t need to justify my position. You need to justify yours. Come back with a warrant. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to hide. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything I feel like showing you, either. If you have nothing to hide, then you don\u0026rsquo;t have a life. It\u0026rsquo;s not about having anything to hide, it\u0026rsquo;s about things not being anyone else\u0026rsquo;s business. You are willing to let me photograph you naked ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly ==funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas==. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. ==It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment==.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Capitalism VS Communism: Who killed more ?"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s your argument to \u0026ldquo;I have nothing to hide\u0026rdquo;? I am by far the most privacy oriented of my friends, and whenever they see me use Firefox or do something other than the norm for privacy They just say, \u0026ldquo;I have nothing to hide\u0026rdquo;. What do you say when someone does this?\nFocusing on \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; is the wrong attitude First of all, \u0026ldquo;Privacy\u0026rdquo; is just the right to control your own data and your public image.\n“Arguing that you don\u0026rsquo;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don\u0026rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” ― Edward Snowden\nPrivacy isn\u0026rsquo;t about hiding something. It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ? Why ? Can I see your credit-card bills for the last year ? Why not ? I don\u0026rsquo;t need to justify my position. You need to justify yours. Come back with a warrant. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to hide. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything I feel like showing you, either. If you have nothing to hide, then you don\u0026rsquo;t have a life.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly ==funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas==. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ?

Why ? Can I see your credit-card bills for the last year ? Why not ? I don\u0026rsquo;t need to justify my position. You need to justify yours. Come back with a warrant. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to hide. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything I feel like showing you, either. If you have nothing to hide, then you don\u0026rsquo;t have a life. It\u0026rsquo;s not about having anything to hide, it\u0026rsquo;s about things not being anyone else\u0026rsquo;s business. You are willing to let me photograph you naked ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades.

And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Yet ignoring that these roundups tend to undercount victims of Nazism, the deaths in China were due to mismanagement and incompetence. The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future. The time for change is now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-climate/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Unseen Consequences of Capitalism on the Environment and Society\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, economic growth, and social inequality, it is essential to examine the underlying drivers of these issues.

This staggering number is a testament to the power of social media in spreading misinformation. Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours.

This staggering number is a testament to the power of social media in spreading misinformation. Fast-forward to the present, and it\u0026rsquo;s safe to assume that the number of false stories shared about the president\u0026rsquo;s policies and character would be significantly higher, potentially exceeding 3 billion.\nWe live in a world where the concept of truth is increasingly blurred. The rise of social media has created an environment where falsehoods can spread like wildfire, often before the truth has a chance to catch up. This phenomenon is eerily reminiscent of the propaganda tactics employed by Hitler\u0026rsquo;s regime, where the falsehoods spread across the globe before the truth could gain traction.\nAs the German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels once said, \u0026ldquo;If you repeat a lie often enough, people will eventually believe it.\u0026rdquo; Social media has amplified this effect, allowing false information to spread at an unprecedented rate. With the ability to present multiple truths and use possessive pronouns to emphasize our own narratives, it\u0026rsquo;s become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction.\nThe question remains: does electoral victory change which version of truth will prevail? In a post-truth world, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say that any particular narrative will dominate the narrative. Instead, we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing a cacophony of competing truths, each with its own set of facts and interpretations.\nTake, for example, the numerous claims that Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, has been used by NASA. While this may sound like an outlandish conspiracy theory, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely unfounded. Some proponents of this claim argue that Sanskrit\u0026rsquo;s complex grammar and syntax are eerily similar to those found in modern programming languages like C++ and Java.\nHowever, despite the lack of concrete evidence, this narrative has gained traction on social media, with many believing it to be true. The fact that this claim has been manipulated and interpreted in a way to serve a particular narrative is a stark reminder of the challenges we face in this post-truth world.\nIn this era of fake news, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to discern fact from fiction. The constant bombardment of conflicting information can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling like we\u0026rsquo;re drowning in a sea of lies.\nSo, what can we do to combat this post-truth world? One approach is to rely on credible sources and fact-checking websites to verify information. We must also be mindful of our own biases and be willing to question our own assumptions.\nUltimately, the battle for truth in a post-truth world is an ongoing one. As we continue to navigate this treacherous terrain, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that we remain vigilant, critical, and committed to seeking out the truth, no matter how difficult it may be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/posttruth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Post-Truth Era: Can We Trust the Truth in a World of Fake News?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 midterm elections, a Stanford University study revealed that fabricated stories supporting Donald Trump had been shared approximately 30 million times in the lead-up to the election.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines.

They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think.

They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

Among the plethora of operating systems available, Linux stands out as a powerful and versatile option that has garnered a dedicated following worldwide. In this blog post, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a journey into the fascinating world of Linux, exploring its origins, features, benefits, and how you can get started with this open-source operating system.\nOrigins of Linux: Linux traces its origins back to the early 1990s when a Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds embarked on a project to create a free and open-source operating system kernel. Inspired by the Unix operating system and dissatisfied with the licensing restrictions of existing systems, Torvalds set out to develop a kernel that would be freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. The result of his efforts was the Linux kernel, which quickly gained popularity among developers and enthusiasts worldwide.\nFeatures and Benefits of Linux: Linux is renowned for its robustness, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from servers and embedded systems to desktop computers and mobile devices. Here are some key features and benefits of Linux:\nOpen Source: Linux is distributed under open-source licenses, which means that the source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism.

Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ?

The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others.

Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

What do you say when someone does this?\nFocusing on \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; is the wrong attitude First of all, \u0026ldquo;Privacy\u0026rdquo; is just the right to control your own data and your public image.\n“Arguing that you don\u0026rsquo;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don\u0026rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” ― Edward Snowden\nPrivacy isn\u0026rsquo;t about hiding something. It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ? Why ? Can I see your credit-card bills for the last year ? Why not ? I don\u0026rsquo;t need to justify my position. You need to justify yours. Come back with a warrant. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to hide. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything I feel like showing you, either. If you have nothing to hide, then you don\u0026rsquo;t have a life.

The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy.

The GDP measures market output: the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy during a given period, usually a year. Governments can fail if this number falls—and so, not surprisingly, governments strive to make it climb. But striving to grow GDP is not the same as ensuring the well-being of a society.\nThe Flawed Metric: Why GDP is Not a Good Measuring Tool As we navigate the complexities of the global economy, it has become increasingly popular to rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a benchmark for measuring a nation\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. However, beneath its seemingly straightforward façade, GDP conceals a multitude of flaws that render it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s true economic health.\nA Definition Problem GDP is calculated by adding up the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country\u0026rsquo;s borders over a specific period, usually a year. The formula is simple:\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\nWhere:\nC = Consumer Spending I = Investment G = Government Spending X = Exports M = Imports This definition raises several concerns. For instance, GDP ignores the quality of goods and services produced, instead focusing solely on their quantity. This can lead to inaccurate representations of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance, particularly in the realm of services. Consider, for example, a country that produces high-quality healthcare services but also has a significant number of low-skilled jobs. GDP would likely give it a high score, while neglecting the fact that many of these jobs are low-wage and lack opportunities for growth.\nThe Value of Unproductive Activity GDP also fails to account for unproductive activity, such as government waste, corruption, and the military-industrial complex. In many countries, a significant portion of GDP is spent on activities that do not contribute to economic growth or improve the standard of living. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and a distorted picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health.\nThe Impact of Inflation GDP is also vulnerable to inflation, which can cause the value of money to change over time. As prices rise, the actual value of GDP decreases, even if the quantity of goods and services produced remains the same. This means that a country with high inflation may have a low GDP, even if its economy is growing rapidly.\nThe Limitations of International Comparison GDP is often used to compare the economic performance of different countries. However, this metric is flawed when it comes to international comparison. Different countries have different economic structures, trade patterns, and income distributions, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, a country with a high GDP may be rich in natural resources, but its economy may be heavily reliant on exports, which can make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.\nThe Neglect of Non-Monetary Outputs GDP neglects non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services, public health, and social welfare. These outputs are essential to a country\u0026rsquo;s economic well-being but are not accounted for in the GDP calculation. For example, a country with high levels of air and water pollution may have a low GDP, even if its citizens are generally happy and healthy.\nAn Alternative: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) In response to the limitations of GDP, researchers have developed alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). GPI takes into account non-monetary outputs, such as environmental services and public health, and adjusts for inflation and other biases. While GPI is not perfect, it provides a more comprehensive picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance and can help policymakers make more informed decisions.\nConclusion GDP may have been a useful metric in the past, but its limitations have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Its focus on quantity over quality, its neglect of unproductive activity, its vulnerability to inflation, and its limitations in international comparison make it an inadequate tool for assessing a country\u0026rsquo;s economic health. As we move forward, it is essential that we develop alternative metrics that can provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a country\u0026rsquo;s economic performance. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a promising alternative that can help policymakers make more informed decisions and ensure that our economic systems serve the needs of all citizens, not just the privileged few.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/gdp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s time to replace gross domestic product with real metrics of well-being and sustainability\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost countries around the world have come to use gross domestic product, or GDP, as the core metric for prosperity.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;.

And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

The modern day \u0026ldquo;death toll contests\u0026rdquo; spawned from boomer-tier memes comparing \u0026ldquo;evil dictators death counts\u0026rdquo; are pointless and devoid of context. Yet ignoring that these roundups tend to undercount victims of Nazism, the deaths in China were due to mismanagement and incompetence. The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive. That\u0026rsquo;s not counting imperialist wars, people who die from unsafe working conditions, slave trading, etc.\nfor active learning You can watch this video\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-vs-communism/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"has-capitalism-killed-more-people-than-communism-throughout-history\"\u003eHas capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow lets dive into details.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

This app is very popular among the Indian youth, and many people use it religiously, like every day from dusk till dawn.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most concerning is the content being churned out by creators, especially in the \u0026ldquo;reels\u0026rdquo; or short video format. So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only. Even more alarming are parents who put their children at risk for content, filming while their toddlers teeter on the edge of beds or wander dangerously close to traffic. The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

I found this content thought-provoking and believe it offers some intriguing background information related to behind-the-scenes dynamics or we can say it provides nuanced view of how things might operate beyond public perception.\nIt was a mid-summer evening in May 2023. Despite the air-conditioning in the Nashik hotel room, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal was sweating profusely. As he sipped a glass of his favourite whisky, he looked and sounded anxious. He had a greying beard, tired eyes and a gaunt look on his face; the spring in his step that had characterized his adventurous political career was missing. Just a few days earlier, he had received yet another notice from the ED in an alleged money laundering case. The original case had been filed in 2016, and the matter had been dragging on ever since. Accused, along with his son and nephew, of irregularities in awarding contracts worth over Rs 100 crore to a Mumbai developer, Bhujbal had already spent two and a half years in jail before he was granted bail. The lengthy period in jail had adversely affected his health, and he was constantly popping pills. ‘I can’t sleep at night just thinking of my days in prison. I am seventy-five now, but they (ED) are still gunning for me,’ he moaned.\n‘But you are such a senior leader. I am sure Sharad Pawar will help you,’ I responded. ‘When you are in trouble, you are alone in life. Who was there to assist me when I was in jail? Matlabi hai saari duniya (The world is selfish),’ Bhujbal lamented, asking his aide to prepare another round of drinks. He recalled how Anil Deshmukh, former home minister and another senior NCP leader, was released after spending thirteen months in jail on money-laundering charges. Upon his release, Deshmukh had alleged he was made an ‘offer’ in jail to join the BJP if he wanted ‘protection’ from the law. ‘Ab woh mujhe bhi Deshmukh ji ki tarah phasana chahate hain (Now they want to trap me like Deshmukh),’ alleged Bhujbal.\nBhujbal, who is a former Maharashtra deputy chief minister, joined Pawar when the latter broke away to form the NCP in 1999. He started his career in the Shiv Sena as one of Bal Thackeray’s key lieutenants. Bhujbal grew up in extreme poverty, living in a tiny one-room tenement near Mumbai’s Byculla market. His family sold flowers and vegetables on the roadside to make ends meet. Now, like so many Maharashtra politicians, he spearheads a vast business empire that stretches across several sectors, from educational institutes to real estate to agriculture. ‘I am a self-made man who has come up the hard way because of my own efforts. The only reason that the agencies are after me is because I come from a humble OBC community. Do you think they will treat any upper-caste politician like this?’ he fulminated. The OBC factor was Bhujbal’s calling card: in a Maratha-dominated political milieu, he used it frequently to emphasize his relevance.\nBhujbal’s life story is compelling; the reasons for his imprisonment less so. The charges of corruption are well-documented, but I was trying to be as empathetic as possible and listened patiently to his woes. ‘There is only one solution now. We have to join hands with Modiji and the BJP. Even Pawar Saheb knows this, only he can’t seem to make up his mind,’ he said as large plates of chicken tikka and seekh kebab were placed on the table. Bhujbal is a generous host. The whisky bottle was almost empty by now. But how will joining hands with the BJP help your case, I asked. ‘Come on, why are you acting innocent? Everyone knows what is happening,’ he retorted.\nJust weeks after this conversation, in July 2023, I was woken up from a Sunday snooze by a colleague on the news desk. ‘We need you live on air right away. The NCP has split. Ajit Pawar is being sworn in along with a few more NCP leaders, all of whom are joining the Eknath Shinde-led BJP–Shiv Sena government,’ he informed me. As I scanned the names of the new cabinet ministers, one name stood out. Chhagan Bhujbal was back in government. A few days later, I met Bhujbal at his official bungalow in Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill area. He had lived in ministerial comfort for much of the previous three decades and seemed completely at ease here—a sharp contrast to the nervous Opposition politician I had met in that dark Nashik hotel room. ‘I assume you are sleeping well now?’ I quipped. ‘Yes, yes, I am so relaxed now, I can’t tell you—it is like a rebirth,’ was Bhujbal’s cheery response. His broad smile was back.\nAs it turned out, the sense of relief in the Bhujbal household was not unfounded. In December 2023, the ED withdrew its petition in\nthe Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of a 2018 order that had granted Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer bail and allowed them to renew their passports and travel abroad. The case was for all practical purposes put in cold storage. Bhujbal was no longer a marked man.\n~ Rajdeep Sardesai\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/behind-the-scenes-in-politics/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am citing a passage from Rajdeep Sardesai\u0026rsquo;s book, \u0026lsquo;2024: The Election That Surprised India,\u0026rsquo; and do not have any personal involvement with the content.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive. That\u0026rsquo;s not counting imperialist wars, people who die from unsafe working conditions, slave trading, etc.\nfor active learning You can watch this video\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-vs-communism/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"has-capitalism-killed-more-people-than-communism-throughout-history\"\u003eHas capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow lets dive into details.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism.

Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

So there are various types of creators on this platform, but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a disturbing trend where people are going to shocking extremes for views—from dangerous stunts to outright self-harm; some are eating literal shit, bathing with gutter water, having abusive fights, and doing things for content that can cause harm to their child only.

We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation.

People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise. This blind faith in unverified social media content reflects a deeper issue: a widespread resistance to critical thinking and fact-checking. Instead of seeking out credible sources or developing informed opinions, many users prefer pre-packaged viewpoints from these dubious content creators.\nThis says a lot about lack of critical thinking in our society. While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

This term immediately caught my attention, as this is very relevant in current scenario. Basically in short, it describes how affluent classes are separating themself from pollution impact and creating safe space at home.\nTraditionally, quarantine involves isolating a source of harm to protect the public. In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments. With air purifiers, bottled water and organic food, affluent individuals build a ‘commodity bubble’ to shield themselves from environmental hazards.\nSociologist Andrew Szasz critiques this approach as it erodes collective action by promoting a sense of complacency. When those with resources can shield themselves from pollution, they feel less urgency to advocate for broader solutions. This cycle risks normalising environmental degradation as something inevitable, something to be managed privately rather than publicly addressed. As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive. That\u0026rsquo;s not counting imperialist wars, people who die from unsafe working conditions, slave trading, etc.\nfor active learning You can watch this video\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-vs-communism/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"has-capitalism-killed-more-people-than-communism-throughout-history\"\u003eHas capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow lets dive into details.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

While it\u0026rsquo;s easy to criticize content creators, the more pressing issue is addressing why millions of users readily accept and propagate unverified information without questioning its validity or source.\nThis raises a crucial question: What content are we consuming daily, and what are we normalizing? People are endlessly scrolling through short-form content where the dopamine hit completely overshadows any sense of wisdom or judgment. The more entertainment a person seeks, the wider his domain gets and the more the supply is. One has to improve the quality of their life in order to improve the kind of entertainment they engage in. People are endlessly scrolling through short forms of content in which the sensation of enjoyment or entertainment during hazardous scrolling overlaps the wisdom at that time, or they are not so much up to considering in between right or wrong content morally or ethically, or they even don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the content they consume on a daily basis.\nI think we should teach people how not to absorb or be influenced by such ideas or actions. Upgrade your standards for entertainment and be more conscious of our digital diet. Because these social media creators, hungry for fame and money, will keep pushing boundaries unless we, as consumers, draw the line. The solution is individual responsibility and digital literacy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/reels/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me share something deeply troubling I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on Instagram recently.

Despite being in my twenties, which is quiet young. still I get the feeling when looking at the extremely talented teenage coders from China, that \u0026ldquo;am I really too old to learn coding ?\u0026rdquo;. I struggled with this feeling for fairly long time but after reading few books on brain and psychology I learned the way of perceiving things. And from there only I learn the term \u0026ldquo;Growth Mindset.\u0026rdquo;. So take it like this there are two types of mindset one is FIXED and other is Growth.\nSo lets discuss, what is a mindset?, a mindset is a self perception or self theory. that people hold about themselves. Individuals often possess preconceived opinions or beliefs (based of experiences or someone told/gave feedback to them) that you are either - intelligent or unintelligent. This is a simple example of mindset. People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets. The whole mindset thing has profound effect on - \u0026ldquo;Learning, achievement, skill development, skill acquisition, personal relationship, success, and a lot other dimensions of life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like intelligence or talent are simply fixed traits. They spend a lot of time in documenting these instead of developing them. And they also believe talent alone can create success, without any effort. Which is certainly not true. The students who believe and adopted fixed mindset knowingly or unknowingly that they are \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, and there is no way to change this , may learn less than they could at slower rate, and because of this they get poor outcome which reinforces this FIXED mindset. When students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell themselves they can’t or won’t be able to do it (“I just can’t learn Algebra”), or they make excuses to rationalize the failure (“I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study”).\nOn contrary, In growth mindset people believe most basic things can be developed through dedicated hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Persons who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.\nSo on a concluding note i just wanna say - Learning is something you can do at any age \u0026ndash; rather then focusing on others, just focus on yourself, and your personal rate of progress. Try and cultivate a \u0026ldquo;growth mindset\u0026rdquo; rather then a \u0026ldquo;fixed mindset\u0026rdquo; or in elite way we can say - Strive to nurture a growth mindset in lieu of perpetuating the shackles of a fixed mindset\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/growth-mindset/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year back I started learning coding.

In contrast, inverted quarantine involves creating personal safe spaces within polluted environments.

As air purifiers top Diwali gift lists, the underlying message is clear: safeguarding one’s health is now a private responsibility, affordable only to those who can pay the price.\nFor Delhi’s marginalised population, however, such protection is out of reach. The cost of a basic air purifier equates to about 15 days’ wages for many, making it an unattainable luxury. Left without the means to shield their homes, they are forced to endure the health risks of pollution, underscoring the growing inequity in access to environmental protection.\nMoreover, there is a psychological element driving this behaviour. Firecrackers, although they worsen air quality, provide immediate, short-term enjoyment that is relatively inexpensive compared to the long-term health investments required to mitigate pollution’s effects, such as air purifiers. The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive.

It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

The pursuit of viral fame has completely overwhelmed basic parental instincts.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night: the rise of meme pages as modern-day propaganda/mass propaganda machines. These pages are often run by kids or a team of losers who don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about politics, opinions, ideologies, neuroscience, human psychology, comedy, finances, etc. They don\u0026rsquo;t know any of these fields but still comment on everything they see. and people have elected the meme pages on Instagram as thought leaders. Somehow, they\u0026rsquo;ve emerged as thought leaders for millions. Think about that for a second. People with no real understanding of complex issues are shaping public opinion on a massive scale.\nThe situation is far worse than most realize. Now with this power, they decide what to spread and what lie to peddle; now they guide the mass thought. Only brainwashing is going on there; they teach people what to think. These meme pages now outnumber regular users on Instagram, and many are secretly funded by government entities, gambling companies, or celebrities pushing their agendas. They are the mass factories of what to think and propaganda spreading. They\u0026rsquo;re not creating content to inform or entertain—they\u0026rsquo;re programming how people think. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated form of mass manipulation, wrapped in the guise of harmless entertainment.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t just random posts we\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through anymore. They\u0026rsquo;re carefully crafted pieces of propaganda, designed to shape perspectives and control narratives. The platform has essentially become a massive thought factory, churning out pre-packaged opinions for millions of unsuspecting young minds.\nNow ask yourself what you are watching. Seriously, a guy performs a dangerous, injurious, harmful, and illegal thing in front of a camera for views and followers, then records himself doing that, then uploads it on a public platform with full consciousness, and then people are like, WTF? I just watched. matter is gone out from the hands of now. We need to draw a line between what is acceptable and what is not. The country where IQ is lower than the room temperature, such things are expected, but the main problem is the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn; despite having access to vast information resources, many users choose to rely on meme pages as their primary source of knowledge and opinion formation. These pages have somehow achieved an almost religious status among followers who accept their content without question. People are literally dumb here in this country. When a meme page makes a statement, it becomes an unquestionable truth for their audience - regardless of its accuracy or the creators\u0026rsquo; lack of expertise.

The transient pleasure of bursting crackers can make it harder for individuals to recognise the long-term harm their actions cause, both to themselves and others. This disconnect between immediate gratification and future health risks creates an even larger obstacle to fostering collective action, further driving the public-private divide.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/inverted-quarantine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently heard this term when I was reading about how people managing their health in polluted environment like Delhi where AQI crossed 1000.

TLDR; without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\nNow lets dive into details. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many arguments agains communism that says - Mao \u0026ldquo;killed 40 million\u0026rdquo; and is thus eviler than Hitler who \u0026ldquo;killed 12 million\u0026rdquo;. The modern day \u0026ldquo;death toll contests\u0026rdquo; spawned from boomer-tier memes comparing \u0026ldquo;evil dictators death counts\u0026rdquo; are pointless and devoid of context. Yet ignoring that these roundups tend to undercount victims of Nazism, the deaths in China were due to mismanagement and incompetence. The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.\nBy reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they\u0026rsquo;re the good guys.\nCapitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.\nSo how many people capitalism killed ? Every year, 9 million people die from hunger, 3.5 million die from lack of clean water, and 1.5 million die from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s 14 million people every year that die simply because it\u0026rsquo;s not profitable to keep them alive. That\u0026rsquo;s not counting imperialist wars, people who die from unsafe working conditions, slave trading, etc.\nfor active learning You can watch this video\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-vs-communism/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"has-capitalism-killed-more-people-than-communism-throughout-history\"\u003eHas capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow lets dive into details.

I am by far the most privacy oriented of my friends, and whenever they see me use Firefox or do something other than the norm for privacy They just say, \u0026ldquo;I have nothing to hide\u0026rdquo;. What do you say when someone does this?\nFocusing on \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; is the wrong attitude First of all, \u0026ldquo;Privacy\u0026rdquo; is just the right to control your own data and your public image.\n“Arguing that you don\u0026rsquo;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don\u0026rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” ― Edward Snowden\nPrivacy isn\u0026rsquo;t about hiding something. It\u0026rsquo;s about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about personal dignity.\nYour data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don\u0026rsquo;t get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll never know it.\nCriminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data. Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.\nFrom the article\nPrivacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.\nFrom Keith axline article\n\u0026quot;Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.\u0026quot; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nSuppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are\nSome responses to the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong\u0026rdquo; argument:\nDo you have curtains ? Why ? Can I see your credit-card bills for the last year ? Why not ? I don\u0026rsquo;t need to justify my position. You need to justify yours. Come back with a warrant. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to hide. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything I feel like showing you, either. If you have nothing to hide, then you don\u0026rsquo;t have a life. It\u0026rsquo;s not about having anything to hide, it\u0026rsquo;s about things not being anyone else\u0026rsquo;s business. You are willing to let me photograph you naked ?

The pursuit of economic growth and profit has led to a paradoxical situation where the very systems designed to benefit humanity are instead contributing to its demise.\nThe Cost of Progress\nThe relentless drive for economic growth and consumption has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. The production of goods and services has become a never-ending cycle of exploitation, where the costs are borne by the planet and its inhabitants, rather than the corporations and individuals reaping the benefits.\n“We\u0026rsquo;ve been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the unpaid costs right in the teeth”\nAs the global economy continues to expand, the environmental and social costs become increasingly apparent. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the exploitation of workers all contribute to the degradation of the planet and the widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Perpetual Treadmill of Production and Consumption\nThe pursuit of profit and growth has created a system where the focus is on continuous production and consumption, rather than sustainability and social responsibility. This has led to a \u0026ldquo;perpetual treadmill\u0026rdquo; where individuals and corporations are driven to produce more, consume more, and waste more, all while ignoring the environmental and social consequences.\nThe Widening Gap\nThe consequences of this system are stark. The gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is the biggest it has been in 50 years, with the top 10% of earners responsible for over 36% of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom 50% are responsible for just 15%. This disparity reflects a broader trend, where those who contribute least to the economy are bearing the brunt of the environmental damage.\nThe Unseen Victims of Climate Change\nThe effects of climate change are not limited to the wealthy and powerful. Individuals in poverty are more likely to be harmed by climate stressors, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity, and food insecurity. The negative impacts of climate change are often invisible to those who are not directly affected, but they can be devastating for communities that are already struggling to make ends meet.\nA New Paradigm?\nIt is time to re-examine the values and priorities of our global economy. We must recognize that economic growth and profit are not the only measures of success, and that the well-being of people and the planet must be prioritized alongside economic considerations.\n“The most profitable decisions will never be the most environmentally friendly, thus private owners of corporations will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions without regulations.”\nUltimately, the choice is ours. We can continue down the path of exploitation and destruction, or we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future. The time for change is now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:51330/posts/capitalism-climate/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Unseen Consequences of Capitalism on the Environment and Society\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, economic growth, and social inequality, it is essential to examine the underlying drivers of these issues.
