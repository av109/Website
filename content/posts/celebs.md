Our society's celebrity worship has reached absurd levels, whether it is a hip-hop artist, actor, or athlete. People look up to them like they are superheroes and can rescue us from our misery. Whether it is existential dread or political chaos, we seem convinced that the solution lies in a celebrity. People project narratives onto them. The reality is far more complex.

The Diljit Dosanjh situation perfectly illustrates this phenomenon. When right-wing activists tried to shut down his Indore concert, he responded by quoting Rahat Indori's powerful lines, "Kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai!" (India belongs to no one's father). After this incident, people cast Diljit as the last hope against right-wing ideologies, a symbol of resistance.

Then came the plot twist and the narrative didn't last long when Diljit posted an image with PM Modi ji. People were shocked, How could their anti-establishment hero do this? Their "anti-establishment hero" was suddenly revealed to be... just another celebrity navigating the complex landscape of public life and professional relationships.

This is the power of mass indoctrination, where people assign meanings to celebrities that they might not embody in reality. What’s happening here? People assign revolutionary labels to celebs without asking if they’re even interested in that role. Do they want to be seen as revolutionaries?

There is something seductive about fame, even back in ancient times = Plato said in The Republic (It's a book not Arnab's channel): "The highest form of recognition is not for the individual, but for the ideas they stand for."

But then standing for the ideas is almost impossible when you have achieved the idea of celebrityhood. In a neoliberal framework, celebrities are commodities, their brand value curated by public relations teams, social media managers, and marketing strategists. We see the celebrity as an individual, ignoring the massive machinery behind them. Celebrities often craft an illusion of relatability—that they think and feel like us. This branding requires effort. Kapil Sharma’s comedy show which is a celeb image-maintenance platform masquerading as a comedy show. Questions like, “Do you buy vegetables yourself?” keep the facade alive of them struggling with everyday issues. This is how many stars often say, “Mujhe toh English words nahi aate,” despite speaking the language fluently, to strike a chord with the insecurities of common people. This is a calculated and smartly curated denial of class privilege, a desperate act of posing as lower class to safeguard upper-class dominance.

The internet, in this age of endless information overload, constantly throws new facts at us, reminding us that the people we once admired have, at some point, might have been 'problematic.' And hence, now they are no longer consumable.

This consistent disillusionment has created a sense of cultural orphanage, where we are now desperately seeking new daddies daily. Yet failing it, every time. The desperation is both laughable and tragic, that evokes Nietzsche’s observation: “The lonely one offers his hand too quickly to anyone who will reach for it.” Or Perhaps rapper MC Stan who once said :

“_**Ek din pyaar phir doosre din tum hate karte**  
Teesre din beemar phir chauthe din tum wait karte_”
