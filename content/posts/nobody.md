*`Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun. — Seth Godin`*

I tell myself that I blog for my own sake. I write to express, to put thoughts out there for my own reflection. I publish things because it helps me tame my thinking. And yet, that tiny toast button somehow becomes a bigger deal than it actually is.

I’d be lying if I say I don’t check the stats. I’m a numbers guy, drawn to tracking things: views and upvotes etc ....

..just another metric to follow, a survey on whether anyone's reading. A measure of... something I'm not sure anymore.

Writing a habit I’ve had an on-off relationship with over the years. I mostly write for myself.  -- writing is clarifying, motivating and fun, even if no one's reading.

So, even if nobody reads my blog, the act of sharing still matters. My writing is still deeply personal, a habit of expression and reflection. And if, by chance, someone wanders in this corner of the web, that connection, however fleeting, is simply a bonus.

"Thanks for reaching this far-flung corner of the internet! It's quite personal here, far from the search engines' reach, and I'm glad you made it!"
