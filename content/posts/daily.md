i follow an artist on Tumblr who’s been doing a daily drawing since a long time.

they’re mostly self portraits.

his work is expressive, somewhat childlike, and genuine.

sometimes he shows pictures of all his notebooks lined up neatly on a wall shelf. years of daily moments recorded with pencils and other colorful media.

a couple of things inspire me:

along with his daily drawings that he posts, he writes a few lines about his day. they’re short snippets of thoughts or daily happenings that leave the reader wanting more.

ex:

_18 September 2024_  
_Onsdag_  

_The logs arrive, I can now start building my house.  
I get to know a guy named Linus, we listen to metal, go shopping in town and do the dishes after dinner._

the other thing that encourages me creatively is that he’s been doing this project since 2008. that’s a long time. It astounds me that more people aren’t liking his drawings.

the number of likes on his work doesn’t seem to faze him.

he just continues drawing, sharing his work, and not making things more complicated than they need to be.

he loves to draw, so he does it
