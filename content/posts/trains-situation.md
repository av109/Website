There's this film series called **The Purge** (2013 - ) I saw a while ago. It's about a single night where, for 12 hours, every crime: murder, robbery, arson, etc goes unpunished. No cops, no courts, no consequences. Just pure, unfiltered chaos. The rich bunker down behind steel doors, while the streets turn into hunting grounds. Grudges get settled in blood, opportunists loot, and those too weak to fight back become easy targets. It’s not about survival. It’s about how far people will go when they know the law can’t touch them.  
  
Right now, to reach Kumbh Mela, thousands of UP-Bihari laborers and unemployed class folks are smashing train windows, breaking doors, and storming compartments of trains reaching railway stations of UP-Bihar. Because they know they can get away with it. No one’s going to arrest them when they can just say they were angry about not getting a ticket / seat to travel for a religious event. The sheer size of the mob makes them untouchable. They’re not just frustrated; they know this is their moment, the one time they can unleash hell and walk away like nothing happened. And just like The Purge, it’s not about fairness. It’s about knowing exactly when the system is too overwhelmed to stop you.  
  
Our society is already halfway there. Where crime isn’t just about hunger or survival, it’s about spotting the cracks in a collapsing system and knowing exactly when to hit. The rich have sucked up all the money, the jobs are gone, the resources are drying up, and instead of fixing anything, they’ve put everyone on a slow drip of religious hysteria, cultural chest-thumping, and nationalist dope. Keep the poor angry at the wrong people, keep the middle class in a slow burn, and make sure the elite never have to see the fire. It’s not a breakdown anymore, it’s the new normal. And at this point, there’s nothing left to do but order steel doors, build bunkers, and hope to God you’re not out in the open when it all finally goes up in flames.
