##  Has capitalism killed more people than communism throughout history? 

TLDR;  without a doubt… there’s never been a world war because of communism. 

Now lets dive into details. I've seen many arguments agains communism that says -  Mao "killed 40 million" and is thus eviler than Hitler who "killed 12 million". The modern day "death toll contests" spawned from boomer-tier memes comparing "evil dictators death counts" are pointless and devoid of context. Yet ignoring that these roundups tend to undercount victims of Nazism, the deaths in China were due to mismanagement and incompetence. The deaths from Nazi Germany were a deliberate policy of starvation and mass slaughter meant to enslave and exterminate inferior races. Nazism also only operated its genocide for 6 years before it was stopped, Hitler himself in power for only 12 years, compared to Mao ruling for several decades. Nazism likely would have killed tens of millions more, again, deliberately, if it had lasted longer.

By reducing it to a contest of numbers, the history and meaning is lost, and all you get is a pointless series of whatabouts where everyone can go home thinking they're the good guys. 

Capitalists have to try and tie events like famines to socialism because they have to make shit up to make it sound like capitalism is an acceptable system. Famines happened in China before Mao and they were going to happen in china regardless of the great leap forward. Same with russia and the broken ass feudal system they had before Lenin. And plenty of famines in India once the Brits took over. Famines in India (and the Indian subcontinent) have reduced significantly after the end of British rule.

## So how many people capitalism killed ?

Every year, [9 million people die](https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/people-and-poverty/hunger-and-obesity/how-many-people-die-from-hunger-each-year) from hunger, [3.5 million die](https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/people-and-poverty/hunger-and-obesity/how-many-people-die-from-hunger-each-year) from lack of clean water, and [1.5 million die](https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/science-history/global-immunization/diseases-and-vaccines-world-view) from preventable illnesses, and we produce enough resources to prevent all of these deaths.

That's 14 million people every year that die simply because it's not profitable to keep them alive. That's not counting imperialist wars, people who die from unsafe working conditions, slave trading, etc.
