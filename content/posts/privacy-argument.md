## What's your argument to "I have nothing to hide"?
I am by far the most privacy oriented of my friends, and whenever they see me use Firefox or do something other than the norm for privacy They just say, "I have nothing to hide". What do you say when someone does this?

## Focusing on "hiding" is the wrong attitude
First of all, "Privacy" is just the right to control your own data and your public image. 

Privacy isn't about hiding something. It's about being able to control how we present ourselves to the world. It is the right to keep things to yourself. It's about personal dignity.

Your data may be used to make decisions about you, without you even knowing. Apply for a job and don't get it ? Get declined for insurance or a car loan or credit card or an apartment rental, or charged a high rate ? The decision may have been based on your data, maybe even mistaken data about you. And you'll never know it.

Criminals are looking to rip you off, and many ways of doing that involve using your private data.
Also, your lack of privacy may affect others around you. If someone can track your activities (or read your email), they will know a lot about the activities of other people you live with or associate with. And those people will have no choice about it.

From [the article](https://www.politico.eu/article/privacy-is-power-opinion-data-gdpr/)

`Privacy was once misconstrued as being about hiding and secrecy. Now it's understood to be something much more pressing: power dynamics between the individual, the state and the market. As recent scandals have illustrated so vividly, privacy is also about the autonomy, dignity, and self-determination of people - and it's a necessary precondition for democracy.`
  

From [Keith axline article](https://re-public.io/blog/privacy-is-just-the-first-step-the-goal-is-data-ownership/)

`"Privacy Is Just the First Step, the Goal Is Data Ownership"` 

`"All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret." -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez`

Suppose you do some searches about cancer, or diabetes, or alcoholism. Do you want that info popping up the next time you apply for health insurance or car insurance or a job ? Even if you don't have cancer, diabetes, or an alcohol problem ? Easiest for the company to just deny you the insurance or the job, rather than investigate or take a risk.

Suppose you're a woman with an abusive ex-husband, or a creepy ex-boyfriend ? Do you want them to be able to track your location in real-time, or track you even if you move to another city ? Or to know where your new job is, or who many of your friends are

Some responses to the "I've got nothing to hide; you have something to hide only if you're doing something wrong" argument:

- Do you have curtains ? Why ?
- Can I see your credit-card bills for the last year ? Why not ?
- I don't need to justify my position. You need to justify yours. Come back with a warrant.
- I don't have anything to hide. But I don't have anything I feel like showing you, either.
- If you have nothing to hide, then you don't have a life.
- It's not about having anything to hide, it's about things not being anyone else's business.
- You are willing to let me photograph you naked ?


I can extend this a lot but I'll later explain why privacy matters in next article.
