Hi, and my name is on top of the site. I am a 24 old guy from India, who loves computers and softwares. I'm a software developer and graphic designer. 

But most importantly `I am a man of culture.`

*This place is home for all my psychological dysfunctioning.* 

*A place where I am in control, with no censorship or manupilation. A place where my words don't get mixed up with noise.*

 key points about me -

*    I have very sensitive cringe sensors.
*    I hate ads.
*    I don't sleep at nights.
*    I love computer science and technology.
*    I believe in good humor or no humor at all.
*    I use arch btw.
